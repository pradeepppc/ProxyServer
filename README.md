RUNNING THE SYSTEM

python server.py

python proxyserver.py    { IN DIFFERENT TABS }


Then goto the Browser and type respective urls

Change the proxy settings in the browser

Now type for your file required

There is cache implemented which has a capacity to store maximum of three messages.

I have implemented the proxyserver so that it could listen multiple users at the same time without blocking
